# Python-based Basic_Blockchain
This project is a basic local proof-of-work blockchain with 'miners'.

## Base Verison
Allows a user to create transactions between clients, add transactions to a block, and mine blocks.

## 'Dynamic' Version
Allows a user to run the program with a user-defiend number of clients and transactions to run.

## MPI Version
Allows the simulation of multiple nodes/miners on a blockchain.
The MPI codes have a dynamic and static (hard-coded transaction data) version.
